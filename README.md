**P4 language tutorials, adapted for the Data Plane Programming Course DVAD41**

We've adapted  a set of exercises to help you get started with P4 programming. They are a set of basic exercises,
some exercises focus on load balancing in data center networks and some on network monitoring.

The exercises have been originally developed for SIGCOMM 2017 and P4D2 2018 EAST. 

The exercises are in the folder /home/p4/tutorials/exercises. On this git, they are located 
[here](P4D2_2018_East/exercises/)
More exercises are available from 

 [Official P4 Github](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials)
and 
 [Stanford CS344 class](https://github.com/CS344-Stanford-18)
